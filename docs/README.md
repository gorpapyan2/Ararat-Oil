- Created comprehensive documentation

For more details:
- [Component Migration Completion Summary](./refactoring/completion-summary.md)
- [Fixes Applied During Migration](./fixes-applied.md)

### How to View the Component Showcase

To see all the migrated components in action:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3003/dev/component-showcase

The showcase includes examples of all 57 components, organized into categories:
- Basic UI components (buttons, badges, avatars)
- Data display components (cards, tables, accordions)
- Input components (form fields, selectors, date pickers)
- Layout components (tabs, layouts)
- Feedback components (alerts, progress indicators, skeletons)

## Documentation Standards

When updating documentation:

1. Use Markdown for all documentation files
2. Include code examples where appropriate
3. Update status markers (‚úÖ, üöß, ‚ùå) to reflect current progress
4. Keep each document focused on a single topic
5. Cross-reference related documents where appropriate

## Developer Tools

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3003/` (or another port if 3003 is in use).

### Component Showcase

To view all UI components in the showcase:

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Navigate to the component showcase
http://localhost:3003/dev/component-showcase
```

### Linting

To run ESLint with automatic fixes:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

This command will automatically fix linting issues while respecting the ignore rules specified in the `.eslintignore` file.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be generated in the `dist` directory.
