## In Progress

- **Unifying Date Picker Components**:
  - ✅ Created a `StandardDatePicker` component with support for both single and range modes
  - ✅ Added keyboard navigation and proper accessibility attributes
  - ✅ Created `FormStandardDatePicker` for React Hook Form integration
  - ✅ Migrated first components:
    - `SalesDatePicker.tsx`
    - `DateRangeFilter.tsx` (in fuel-supplies)
  - 🔄 Continuing migration of remaining date picker components

## Next Steps: StandardDatePicker Component

Our next focus is to continue the migration of date picker components throughout the codebase:

1. **Remaining Component Migrations**:
   - Replace all instances of the original DatePicker with our new StandardDatePicker
   - Migrate all form implementations to use FormStandardDatePicker
   - Update test files to use the new components

2. **Implementation Progress**:
   - ✅ Phase 1: Created base components (StandardDatePicker)
   - ✅ Phase 2: Created form field wrapper (FormStandardDatePicker)
   - 🔄 Phase 3: Migrating existing components, starting with simpler implementations
   - ⏳ Phase 4: Update feature-specific date pickers

3. **Target Components to Replace** (remaining):
   - `src/core/components/ui/composed/datepicker.tsx`
   - `src/core/components/ui/composed/daterangepicker.tsx`
   - `src/core/components/ui/primitives/form-fields.tsx` (FormDatePicker section)
   - `src/core/components/ui/composed/form-fields.tsx` (FormDatePicker section)
   - `src/features/fuel-supplies/components/FuelSuppliesDatePicker.tsx` (actual implementation)

## Planned Refactorings

### High Priority
- **Dialog Components**: Continue migrating existing dialogs to use the standardized patterns
- **UI Component Consolidation**: Unify duplicate UI components including:
  - **Date Pickers**: Create a single, accessible date picker component
  - **Card Components**: Standardize card components across the application

### Medium Priority
- **Table Components**: Standardize table implementations
- **Form Field Components**: Further consolidate form field implementations
- **Additional Test Utilities**: Create more reusable test utilities

### Long Term
- **Component Library Documentation**: Document all standard components
- **Migration Strategy**: Plan for migration of remaining components
- **Metrics Collection**: Continue tracking duplication rates and other code quality metrics

## Metrics Tracking

| Date       | Duplication Rate | TypeScript | JavaScript | SQL    | Notes                             |
|------------|------------------|------------|------------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| 2023-11-15 | 5.12%           | 4.95%      | 7.66%      | 24.1%  | Initial measurement               |
| 2023-11-20 | 4.84%           | 4.82%      | 7.21%      | 24.1%  | After StandardButton refactoring  |
| 2023-11-27 | 4.62%           | 4.64%      | 6.89%      | 24.1%  | After StandardDialog refactoring  |
| 2023-12-01 | 4.54%           | 4.25%      | 6.85%      | 24.1%  | After FormField standardization   |
| 2023-12-06 | 4.27%           | 3.79%      | 6.27%      | 24.1%  | After ExpenseDialogStandardized   |
| 2023-12-08 | 4.31%           | 3.88%      | 6.34%      | 22.67% | After ProfileDialogStandardized   |
| 2023-12-12 | 4.29%           | 3.88%      | 6.31%      | 22.67% | After TankFormDialog refactoring  |

## High Priority Areas

1. **Testing Utilities**: The duplication check shows identical test patterns in multiple files like `useTanks.test.ts`, `useEmployees.test.ts`, and others. Continuing to extract common patterns into reusable utilities will further reduce duplication.

2. **Form Components**: Form fields and validation logic remain a significant source of duplication. While we've made progress with `StandardForm`, we should continue to enhance this pattern.

3. **Dialog Components**: We've created standardized dialog components, but need to migrate the remaining dialogs to use these patterns.

4. **Date Pickers**: Multiple date picker implementations show up in the duplication report. Consolidating these into a single, accessible component will improve both code quality and user experience.

5. **Card Components**: Cards in `src/core/components/ui/primitives/card.tsx` show significant internal duplication.

## Notes

The codebase has shown significant improvement in structure and maintainability. We've successfully reduced the duplication rate from the initial 5.12% to 4.29%. The most recent refactoring of the TankFormDialog component completes our dialog standardization efforts, with four major dialog components now using the FormDialog pattern.

We've now begun addressing the date picker duplication by creating a unified StandardDatePicker component that handles both single date and date range modes. Our implementation provides improved accessibility with ARIA attributes and proper keyboard navigation. We've successfully migrated two components to use this new standardized component, and we'll continue migrating the remaining date picker implementations across the codebase.

TypeScript components now show a duplication rate of only 3.88%, with TSX files at 3.66% and JavaScript at 6.31%. The form and dialog components are now more consistent and type-safe, which has improved developer productivity.

Our next area of focus will be unifying the date picker components, which still show significant duplication between DatePicker and DateRangePicker implementations. After that, we'll continue addressing smaller areas of duplication in the remaining form fields.
