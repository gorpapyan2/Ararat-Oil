# Remaining Issues After Refactoring

## Overview

This document lists the remaining issues that were identified during the refactoring process but were not fully addressed in the current phase. It also tracks items that have been fixed.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Tailwind Configuration**:
   - ✅ DarkMode settings adjusted to fix type error
   - ✅ Container configuration updated
   - ⚠️ Font-sans utility class error needs fixing in the CSS base layer

2. **Component Implementations**:
   - ✅ Sheet component created in primitives directory
   - ✅ Button component implementation fixed and exports added
   - ✅ Card component implementation fixed and exports added
   - ✅ TodoPage component created and implemented

## Remaining Linting and Typechecking Issues

1. **Import Path Issues**:
   - Some components still have incorrect import paths
   - Need to ensure all imports use consistent path patterns

2. **Component Type Issues**:
   - Some components have `any` type annotations that should be properly typed
   - Field types in form components could be more strictly typed

3. **Path Aliases**:
   - Consider implementing path aliases in tsconfig.json and vite.config.ts
   - This would simplify imports and make them more maintainable

## Application Functionality

1. **Todo Feature**:
   - ✅ The TodoPage component was created
   - ⚠️ Integration with actual data storage needed

2. **Component Testing**:
   - UI components lack comprehensive tests
   - Add tests for both individual components and their integrations

## Documentation

1. **Component API Documentation**:
   - Add detailed documentation for each UI component
   - Include usage examples and props information

2. **Migration Completion Checklist**:
   - ✅ Created component migration status tracker
   - Continue tracking completion status

## Next Steps

1. Address the font-sans and other Tailwind utility class errors
2. Convert any remaining `any` types to proper TypeScript types
3. Implement path aliases for cleaner imports
4. Add data storage integration for TodoPage
5. Add component tests
6. Enhance component documentation
