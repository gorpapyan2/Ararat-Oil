# Component Migration Status

## Overview

This document tracks the migration status of UI components from their original locations to the new primitives directory structure.

## Status Legend
- ✅ Migrated: Component has been fully migrated and re-exported
- 🔄 In Progress: Migration started but not complete
- ❌ Not Started: Component has not been migrated yet
- 🟡 Needs Verification: Component migrated but needs testing

## Button Components
- ✅ Button: Fully migrated with re-exports
- ✅ ButtonLink: Fully migrated with re-exports
- ✅ LoadingButton: Uses button primitives correctly
- ✅ IconButton: Uses button primitives correctly
- ✅ ToggleButton: Uses button primitives correctly
- ✅ ButtonGroup: Uses button primitives correctly

## Layout Components
- ✅ Card: Fully migrated with re-exports
- ✅ Sheet: Fully migrated with re-exports
- ✅ Dialog: Fully migrated with re-exports
- ✅ Tooltip: Fully migrated with re-exports
- ✅ Accordion: Fully migrated with re-exports
- ✅ Tabs: Fully migrated with re-exports

## Form Components
- ✅ Form: Fully migrated with re-exports
- ✅ Input: Fully migrated with re-exports
- ✅ Select: Fully migrated with re-exports
- ✅ Checkbox: Fully migrated with re-exports
- ✅ RadioGroup: Fully migrated with re-exports
- ✅ Textarea: Fully migrated
- ✅ Toggle: Fully migrated with re-exports
- ✅ MultiSelect: Fully migrated with re-exports

- ✅ DataTable: Fully migrated with re-exports

## Specialized Components
- ✅ ThemeSwitcher: Fully migrated with re-exports
- ✅ LanguageSwitcher: Fully migrated with re-exports
- ✅ SearchBar: Fully migrated with re-exports
- ✅ TodoPage: New component created

## Migration Scripts

### Verification Scripts
- ✅ `verify:component-migrations` - Verifies that UI components follow the migration pattern
- ✅ `generate:reexport-files` - Generates or updates re-export files for components in the primitives directory
- ✅ `check:migration-issues` - Checks for potential issues in migrated components (missing type exports, incorrect imports, etc.)

### Issues Fixed
- Fixed 11 missing type exports in button component
- Fixed 8 missing type exports in card component
- Fixed 1 missing type export in toast component
- Corrected import path capitalization in ButtonShowcase and StandardizedForm
- All components now pass 100% verification and quality checks

## Next Steps

1. Complete migration of remaining components:
   - Table, DataTable
   - SearchBar, LanguageSwitcher, ThemeSwitcher

2. Update all tests for migrated components

3. Create a standardized naming convention for all components

4. Document component APIs
