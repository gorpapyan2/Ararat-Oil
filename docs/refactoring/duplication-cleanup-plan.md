# Ararat OIL Codebase Duplication Cleanup Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our comprehensive plan to eliminate code duplication and improve the overall architecture of the Ararat OIL application codebase.

## Identified Duplication Areas

1. **UI Component Duplication**
   - Button components in multiple locations
   - Card components implemented across different features
   - Dialog components with similar functionality

2. **Form Component Duplication**
   - Multiple standardized form implementations across different features
   - Similar form components in both core and feature-specific directories

3. **Directory Structure Issues**
   - Both `shared/components` and `core/components` containing base components
   - Feature-specific components that could be abstracted to shared components

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation Reorganization

1. **Create Unified Component Directory Structure**
   - Establish clear separation between presentation components and business logic
   - Move all UI components to `src/components` focused solely on presentation
   - Create subdirectories for different component types (ui, layout, forms)

2. **Consolidate Hooks**
   - Move all hooks to `src/hooks` directory
   - Create subdirectories for different hook types (form, data, ui)
   - Ensure hooks follow the naming convention `use[Feature][Action]`

3. **Reorganize Business Logic**
   - Move all business logic to `src/services` organized by domain
   - Separate data fetching and mutations into dedicated files
   - Create a clear API boundary between UI and business logic

### Phase 2: Component Consolidation

1. **UI Component Library**
   - Create a unified set of primitive components (Button, Input, etc.)
   - Update all imports to use the new components
   - Remove duplicated implementations
   - Maintain the olive-lime color palette (#000000, #3E432E, #616F39, #A7D129)

2. **Form Component Standardization**
   - Create a standardized form component system
   - Extract common form patterns into reusable components
   - Update all forms to use the new system

3. **Layout Component Unification**
   - Standardize layout components across the application
   - Create a consistent grid system
   - Update all page layouts to use the standardized components

### Phase 3: Cleanup and Documentation

1. **Remove Deprecated Code**
   - Remove all deprecated components after migrating their usages
   - Clean up unused imports and files
   - Run linting and formatting tools to ensure code quality

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update component documentation
   - Create usage examples for the new component library
   - Document the architecture and design decisions

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Ensure all components render correctly
   - Verify all functionality works as expected
   - Fix any issues that arise during testing

## Migration Timeline

1. **Phase 1**: 1 week
2. **Phase 2**: 2 weeks
3. **Phase 3**: 1 week

## Best Practices to Follow

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Each component should have a single responsibility
   - Separate presentation from business logic

2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Extract common patterns into reusable components
   - Use composition over inheritance

3. **Consistent Naming Conventions**
   - Use clear, descriptive names for components, hooks, and services
   - Follow established naming patterns across the codebase

4. **Proper Type Definitions**
   - Define clear interfaces for all components and functions
   - Use TypeScript effectively to catch errors at compile time

5. **Documentation**
   - Document all components with JSDoc comments
   - Create usage examples for complex components
   - Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
