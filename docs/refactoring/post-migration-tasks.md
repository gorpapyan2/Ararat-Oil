# Post-Migration Tasks

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete after the successful migration of components from the legacy `src/components` directory to the new feature-based architecture.

## Current Status

âœ… **Components Migration Complete**:
- All components have been organized into feature, core, and shared directories
- The legacy `src/components` directory has been removed
- A backup of the original components is preserved in `backups/components-backup`

## Immediate Tasks

### 1. Fix Form Showcase Pages

The form showcase pages still reference components that no longer exist:

- `src/pages/form-showcase.tsx` - Original page with broken imports
- `src/pages/form-showcase-new.tsx` - Replacement page (also with broken imports)

**Solution:**
- Complete implementation of all required UI components in `src/core/components/ui/`
- Replace `form-showcase.tsx` with the content from `form-showcase-new.tsx`
- Update all imports in the showcase page to reference the new component locations

### 2. Address Missing Target Components

Several bridge components were pointing to targets that don't exist yet:

- Components in `features/fuel-supplies/components/`
- Various UI components in `core/components/ui/`

**Solution:**
- Create the missing target components based on the backup
- Ensure all functionality is preserved
- Update tests to reference the new component locations

### 3. Run Full Test Suite

Verify that the migration hasn't broken any functionality:

```bash
npm run test
```

Address any test failures by updating component imports or fixing component implementations.

## Future Tasks

### 1. Deprecation Monitoring Dashboard

Create a dashboard to track usage of deprecated components:

- Monitor console warnings in development mode
- Track which bridge components are still being accessed
- Prioritize removal of unused bridge components

### 2. Developer Tooling

Implement tools to assist with the new architecture:

- Component generators for creating new feature components
- Linting rules to enforce architectural patterns
- Migration guides for developers

### 3. Documentation Updates

Update all documentation to reflect the new architecture:

- Component usage guides
- Developer onboarding materials
- Architecture diagrams

## Timeline

| Task | Priority | Estimated Completion |
|------|----------|----------------------|
| Fix Form Showcase Pages | High | 1-2 days |
| Address Missing Components | High | 1 week |
| Run Full Test Suite | High | 1-2 days |
| Deprecation Dashboard | Medium | 2 weeks |
| Developer Tooling | Medium | 3-4 weeks |
| Documentation Updates | Medium | Ongoing |

## Conclusion

The migration to a feature-first architecture represents a significant improvement in the codebase organization. Completing these post-migration tasks will ensure a smooth transition for developers and maintain the stability of the application.
