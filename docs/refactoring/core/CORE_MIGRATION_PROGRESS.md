### Pending Items
- None (all configuration files have been migrated)

## State Management Migration

### Completed Items
- [x] `useAppStore.ts` → `src/core/store/appStore.ts`

- [x] Enhance type safety with const assertions
- [x] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [x] Create migration documentation
- [x] Update imports throughout the application
- [x] Remove old store files

### Pending Items
- [ ] Evaluate need for additional stores

## Migration Notes

### Navigation Configuration
- The `useSidebarNavConfig` hook was migrated from `src/config/sidebarNav.ts` to `src/core/config/navigation.ts`
- All imports in `src/layouts/Sidebar.tsx`, `src/hooks/useBreadcrumbs.tsx`, and `src/layouts/AdminShell.tsx` were updated
- Documentation was added to the hook

### Environment Configuration
- Created a new `src/core/config/environment.ts` file
- Added functions to check the current environment
- Added environment type definitions
- Added utility functions `isDevelopment()`, `isTest()`, and `isProduction()`

### Feature Flags Configuration
- Created a new `src/core/config/feature-flags.ts` file
- Implemented a feature flag system that reads from environment variables
- Default flags are set based on environment
- Added functions `getFeatureFlags()` and `isFeatureEnabled()`

### Constants Configuration
- Created a new `src/core/config/constants.ts` file
- Added commonly used constant values, organized by category
- Includes pagination settings, timeouts, storage keys, and more

### API Configuration
- Created a new `src/core/config/api.ts` file
- Consolidated API endpoints and configuration in one place
- Added configuration for API timeouts, retries, and error handling
- Organized endpoints by entity type

### Theme Configuration
- Created a new `src/core/config/theme.ts` file
- Centralized theme-related configuration including color schemes and layout settings
- Added type definitions for theme options
- Organized styling constants by category (colors, fonts, animations, etc.)

### Routes Configuration
- Created a new `src/core/config/routes.ts` file
- Defined a structured routes configuration with metadata
- Added helper functions for working with routes
- Organized routes by section (fuel management, finance, etc.)

### App Store
- Migrated from `src/store/useAppStore.ts` to `src/core/store/appStore.ts`
- Enhanced with type-safe selectors for all state properties
- Integrated with the core configuration, using constants from THEME_CONFIG
- Added advanced TypeScript features like const assertions and explicit return types
- Improved code organization with meaningful constants and documentation
- Added comprehensive unit tests to validate functionality
- Updated theme system to use configuration constants

### Todo Store
- Migrated from `src/store/useTodoStore.ts` to `src/core/store/todoStore.ts`
- Enhanced with type-safe selectors for derived state (counts, filters, etc.)
- Added utility function `getFilteredTodos` to centralize filtering and sorting logic
- Used const assertions for better type safety on enums and constants
- Improved organization with proper TypeScript typing
- Added comprehensive unit tests
- Fixed type errors and improved type safety

### API Client
- Created a new core API client in `src/core/api/client.ts`
- Implemented the Supabase client in `src/core/api/supabase.ts`
- Added type-safe response handling with `ApiResponse<T>` interface
- Created structured error handling with specific error types
- Implemented type definitions in `src/core/api/types.ts`
- Migrated the following endpoints to `src/core/api/endpoints/`:
  - Fuel Supplies API
  - Shifts API
  - Tanks API
  - Fuel Types API
  - Filling Systems API
  - Petrol Providers API
  - Expenses API
  - Transactions API
  - Dashboard API
  - Profit Loss API
  - Sales API
  - Employees API
  - Fuel Prices API
  - Financials API
- Consolidated Shift Payment Methods functionality within Shifts API
- Consolidated Fuel Management functionality across relevant fuel endpoints
- Consolidated exports in `src/core/api/index.ts`
- Added unit tests for the API client
- Created documentation for API migration in `docs/refactoring/core/API_MIGRATION.md`

## Import Guidelines

When importing from core modules, use the centralized imports:

```typescript
// Good - use centralized imports
import { useAppStore, useTodoStore, getFilteredTodos } from '@/core/store';
import { useSidebarNavConfig, isFeatureEnabled, PAGINATION } from '@/core/config';
import { fuelSuppliesApi, shiftsApi, supabase } from '@/core/api';

// Avoid - don't import directly from specific files
import { useAppStore } from '@/core/store/appStore';
import { useSidebarNavConfig } from '@/core/config/navigation';
import { fuelSuppliesApi } from '@/core/api/endpoints/fuel-supplies';
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete the migration of all API endpoints from `src/services/` to `src/core/api/endpoints/`
2. Update imports in the application to use the new core API client
3. Add unit tests for the API client and endpoints
4. Migrate internationalization functionality to `src/core/i18n/`
5. Remove the old files once all dependencies have been updated and tested
6. Add comprehensive tests for core functionality

## Testing

After each migration:
1. Run the application to ensure it functions correctly
2. Update and run relevant unit tests
3. Check for any console errors related to the migration
