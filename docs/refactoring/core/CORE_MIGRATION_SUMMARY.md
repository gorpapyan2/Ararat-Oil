# Core API Migration Summary

This document summarizes the work done to migrate from the old service-based API structure to the new core API client architecture.

| Fuel Management | ‚úÖ | New implementation for dashboard |
| Expenses | ‚úÖ | Migrated to core API |
| Transactions | ‚úÖ | Migrated to core API |
| Dashboard | ‚úÖ | Migrated to core API |
| Profit/Loss | ‚úÖ | Migrated to core API |
| Financials | ‚úÖ | Migrated to core API |
| Logger | ‚úÖ | Integrated into core API structure |

## Components Updated

The following components have been updated to use the new API structure:

- `FuelSuppliesManagerStandardized.tsx`
- `FuelManagementDashboard.tsx`
- `Shifts.tsx`
- `ShiftDetails.tsx`
- `FuelPricesPage.tsx`
- `PriceAndEmployeeInputs.tsx`
- `FuelSuppliesDebugger.tsx`
- All hooks using the old services (e.g., `useSalesFilters.ts`, `useFuelSuppliesFilters.ts`)

## Fixed Linter Errors

Several linter errors were fixed during the migration:

1. **Type Export Issues**:
   - Fixed re-export of types using `export type` syntax for TypeScript's isolatedModules mode

2. **API Implementation Consistency**:
   - Updated API implementations to ensure method names match across the codebase
   - Fixed method signatures to align with component expectations

3. **Type Compatibility**:
   - Resolved type mismatches between components and API interfaces
   - Created consistent type definitions for selection states (`FuelTypeSelection`)
   - Aligned property names (`fuel_type` vs `fuel_type_id`) for consistency

4. **Component Prop Types**:
   - Fixed ConsumptionChart data structure to match the API response format
   - Ensured proper typing for dropdown selections and API filters

## Key Improvements

1. **Type Safety**: All API calls now return a consistent `ApiResponse<T>` type, making error handling more predictable.

2. **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling with proper typing via the `ApiError` interface.

3. **Code Organization**: Services are now organized under a consolidated API client structure.

4. **Dependency Management**: Components now depend on the core API client rather than individual services.

5. **Testability**: The new structure makes mocking and testing easier.

## Next Steps

1. Replace mock implementations with actual API calls when backend services are ready.

2. Add unit tests for all API services.

3. Consider adding response caching for frequently accessed data.

4. Add request/response logging for debugging in development mode.

5. Implement proper API retry logic for network failures.

## Migration Process

The migration followed these steps:

1. Created core API client structure with proper types and response handling
2. Migrated individual services to the new structure
3. Updated components to use the new services
4. Fixed TypeScript errors and added proper type safety
5. Validated functionality throughout the application 
6. Resolved linter errors to ensure code quality
