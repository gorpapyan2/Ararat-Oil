## Technical Debt Management

### Identified Issues
- **Hook Interface Inconsistencies**: Some hooks return query objects directly while others return extracted properties
- **JSX/TSX Test Configuration**: Test files show consistent TypeScript errors related to JSX parsing
- **Legacy Service References**: Some components still use old service layer directly

### Deprecation Strategy
1. Identify all legacy services still in use (June 5, 2023)
2. Add formal deprecation notices with removal timeline (June 12, 2023)
3. Create migration examples for legacy service consumers (June 19, 2023)
4. Document migration path for components (June 26, 2023)
5. Implement usage logging for deprecated services (July 3, 2023)

- [ ] UI matches existing implementation
- [ ] Data flow properly uses new hooks
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met
