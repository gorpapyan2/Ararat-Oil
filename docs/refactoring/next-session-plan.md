# Next Implementation Session Plan

## Current Progress

As of 2025-05-24, we have successfully implemented 23 key components, which represents approximately 37% of the total required components. The components implemented so far include:

- **UI Primitives**: Button, Card, Alert, Input, Select, Separator, Label, Checkbox, Textarea, RadioGroup, Switch, Popover, Slider, Dialog, Tooltip, Tabs, Accordion, Table, DropdownMenu, Badge
- **Composed Components**: Form, DatePicker, DateRangePicker

These components cover basic UI elements, form controls, interaction patterns, navigation components, and data display components, providing a comprehensive foundation for the application.

## Accomplishments Over Past Sessions

- Implemented 20 core UI primitives with TypeScript safety and accessibility
- Created 3 composed components with advanced functionality
- Developed a comprehensive form system with React Hook Form integration
- Established consistent API patterns and styling across all components
- Implemented interaction components with rich feedback mechanisms
- Added proper error handling and validation support to all form components
- Created navigation components for organizing and displaying hierarchical content
- Developed data display components for tabular information
- Built contextual menu systems for actions and navigation

## Next Session Goals

For the next session, we aim to implement:

1. **User Interface Components**:
   - Avatar component for user representation
   - Calendar component for date picking and display
   - Toast and Toaster components for notifications

2. **Utility Components**:
   - Sheet component for sliding panels
   - Skeleton component for loading states

3. **Integration Work**:
   - Create showcase pages for implemented components
   - Develop integration examples showing component combinations

## Implementation Priority

1. **Avatar First**: Implement the Avatar component as a foundational element
2. **Calendar Second**: Create the Calendar component which will be used by the existing DatePicker
3. **Toast System**: Implement the Toast and Toaster components for notifications
4. **Utility Components**: Build the Sheet and Skeleton components
5. **Integration Examples**: Create showcase pages demonstrating component combinations

## Technical Considerations

- The Calendar component should coordinate with the existing DatePicker implementation
- The Toast system will require careful state management for notification queuing
- The Avatar component should handle various image loading states gracefully
- Ensure all components support dark mode through the design system
- Maintain consistent patterns established in previous components
- Add comprehensive tests for all implemented components

## Documentation to Update

- Component implementation status (after each component is completed)
- Update showcase pages to demonstrate the new components
- Add comprehensive documentation for each component's API
- Create usage examples for common component combinations

## Success Criteria for Next Session

- Implement at least 5 more components (Avatar, Calendar, Toast, Toaster, Sheet, Skeleton)
- Create showcase pages for the Table, DropdownMenu, and Badge components
- Develop at least 3 integration examples showing component combinations
- Ensure all components pass TypeScript checks and unit tests
- Maintain the consistent design patterns established in previous sessions

By the end of the next session, we should have approximately 45% of the components fully implemented, with a focus on completing the user interface and utility components that enhance the application's user experience.
