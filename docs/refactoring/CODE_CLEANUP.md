## Removed Unused Dependencies

- Identified and removed unused dependencies from package.json
- Cleaned up unnecessary imports in various files

## Consolidated Utility Functions

- Combined duplicate utility functions in `src/utils/index.ts`
- Removed repeated code across multiple files
- Created specialized utility categories:
  - Date formatting
  - String manipulation
  - Number formatting
  - Validation helpers

## Created Reusable Components

The following reusable components were created to reduce duplication:

### Form Handling

- `StandardForm`: A base form component that standardizes form handling with React Hook Form and Zod validation
- `FormRow`: A component for consistent form field layouts
- Import both from `@/core/components/ui`

### Dialog Components

- `StandardDialog`: Base dialog for common dialog patterns
- `ConfirmDialog`: Dialog for confirmation actions
- `DeleteConfirmDialog`: Specialized dialog for deletion confirmations
- Import all from `@/core/components/ui` (prefixed with `Base`)

### Component Imports

Created a centralized export point for UI components in `src/core/components/ui/index.ts`, which:
- Re-exports all primitive components
- Re-exports composed components
- Allows for simplified imports: `import { Button, TextField } from '@/core/components/ui'`

## Testing Improvements

Created shared test utilities to standardize and simplify test setup:

### Test Setup Utilities (`src/test/utils/test-setup.ts`)

- `setupHookTest`: Utility for testing data fetching hooks
  - Handles mock implementation for API fetching
  - Provides standardized QueryClient setup
  - Mocks toast notifications and translations
  
- `setupErrorTest`: Utility for testing error handling paths
  - Standardizes error testing across components
  
- `setupMutationTest`: Utility for testing mutation hooks
  - Provides mock mutation functions
  
- `setupComponentTest`: Utility for component testing
  - Standardizes provider wrapping and mocking

### Usage Example

```tsx
// Before
const wrapper = () => {
  const queryClient = new QueryClient({
    defaultOptions: { queries: { retry: false } },
  });
  return ({ children }) => (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      {children}
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
};

const { result } = renderHook(() => useMyHook(), { wrapper });

// After
const { renderTestHook, mockFetch } = setupHookTest();
mockFetch.mockResolvedValue(mockData);
const { result } = renderTestHook(() => useMyHook());
```

## Code Duplication Analysis

Used `jscpd` to analyze code duplication in the codebase. Key findings:

- Identified several patterns of duplication in test files, especially in hook tests and component tests
- Found duplicate dialog implementations across multiple components
- Discovered multiple implementations of form handling logic with React Hook Form

### Duplication Status

- Initial status: High duplication, especially in test files and common UI patterns
- Current status: Reduced duplication by creating shared utilities and base components
- Remaining issues: Some test files still need to be refactored to use the new utilities

### Next Steps

- Continue refactoring test files to use the shared test utilities
- Review component-specific dialogs to use the new base dialog components
- Review form implementations to use the StandardForm component

## Cleanup Tasks Completed

### 1. Dependency Management
- ✅ Removed unused dependencies:
  - `@tailwindcss/postcss`
  - `react-swipeable`
  - Unused Storybook dependencies 
  - `@types/jest`
- ✅ Added missing dependencies:
  - `@typescript-eslint/parser`
  - `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`
  - `eslint-plugin-react`
  - `file-saver`
  - `jspdf-autotable`

### 2. Code Duplication Reduction
- ✅ Created unified test utilities in `src/test/utils/test-helpers.ts`
- ✅ Refactored form field components to use a base component
- ✅ Consolidated duplicate Supabase types
- ✅ Removed redundant `form-showcase-new.tsx` file 
- ✅ Consolidated formatting utilities into a central location
- ✅ Created proper re-export files to enable importing from unified locations

### 3. Type System Improvements
- ✅ Streamlined database type definitions
- ✅ Ensured proper types are used throughout the application

### 4. Linter Error Fixes
- ✅ Fixed naming conflicts in form components by renaming local declarations
- ✅ Resolved ambiguous exports in utility files with named exports
- ✅ Separated React component wrappers into .tsx files to fix JSX issues
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors in test utilities

## Duplication Detection Results

Before the cleanup, the codebase had approximately:
- 222 detected code clones
- 5.14% of the codebase was duplicated (5,175 lines)

The primary sources of duplication were:
1. Test setup code
2. Form field components with similar patterns
3. Database type definitions in multiple locations
4. Formatting and utility functions

## Guidelines for Preventing Future Duplication

### 1. Use Centralized Exports
Always export shared functionality through index files:
```ts
// Bad: Importing directly 
import { formatDate } from '@/utils/formatting';

// Good: Use centralized exports
import { formatDate } from '@/utils';
```

### 2. Create Base Components
When creating similar components, create a base component:
```tsx
// Instead of duplicating patterns, create base components:
function BaseField({ /* common props */ }) {
  // Common implementation
}

export function TextField(props) {
  return <BaseField type="text" {...props} />;
}

export function NumberField(props) {
  return <BaseField type="number" {...props} />;
}
```

### 3. Use Test Utilities
Create and use test utilities for common test patterns:
```ts
// Instead of duplicating test setup, use utilities:
import { setupApiHookTest } from '@/test/utils';

describe('MyHook', () => {
  it('fetches data correctly', () => {
    const { queryClient, mockFetch } = setupApiHookTest({ data: [] });
    // Test with standard setup
  });
});
```

### 4. Regularly Check for Duplication
Run the duplication analysis regularly:
```bash
npx jscpd src
```

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring for code duplication
2. Implement a pre-commit hook to detect significant code duplication
3. Refactor remaining test files to use the new test utilities
4. Create additional specialized utilities for commonly duplicated code patterns
5. Fix remaining linter errors throughout the codebase

## Additional Improvements Made

### 1. Better TypeScript Type Safety
- Improved type safety in test utilities
- Added proper typing for form field components
- Used proper naming to avoid conflicts

### 2. Code Organization
- Separated React components with JSX into .tsx files
- Grouped related utilities with clear naming conventions
- Created specialized utility files for different concerns

### 3. Documentation
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to utility functions
- Ensured each function has proper parameter and return type documentation
- Added examples in comments where appropriate
