# Employee Feature Refactoring Guide

This document tracks the refactoring progress for the Employee feature to align with the new feature-based architecture.

## Completed Tasks

### Code Structure
- [x] Moved employee-related code to feature folder structure
- [x] Created clear separation between domain models and database types
- [x] Implemented proper type definitions in `types/employees.types.ts`
- [x] Created utility functions for data mapping in `utils/employeeMappers.ts`
- [x] Fixed circular dependencies by updating imports to use `@/services/supabase`

### Type Safety
- [x] Added explicit typing for all service methods
- [x] Created comprehensive type interfaces for:
  - Employee domain model
  - Employee form data
  - Employee filters
  - Employee summary statistics
- [x] Added proper null handling and error management

### Data Mapping
- [x] Created utility functions to map between database and domain models:
  - `mapDbToEmployee`: Converts database records to domain model
  - `mapEmployeeToDb`: Converts domain model to database format
- [x] Added helper functions:
  - `extractDepartment`: Parses department info from status field
  - `normalizeStatus`: Ensures valid status values

### Testing
- [x] Created unit tests for mapper functions
- [x] Tested all edge cases and data transformation scenarios
- [x] Ensured type compatibility between service and component layers

## Next Steps

### Component Layer
- [x] Update employee components to use the new service
- [x] Ensure proper error handling in UI components
- [x] Add loading states for async operations

### Form Handling
- [x] Update forms to use the defined `EmployeeFormData` type
- [x] Implement form validation using Zod schemas
- [x] Add proper error messages for validation failures

### Data Fetching
- [x] Implement data prefetching for improved UX
- [x] Add caching strategy for employee data
- [x] Implement optimistic updates for employee mutations

## Implementation Notes

### Database Structure
The employees table in the database has the following structure:
- `id`: UUID primary key
- `name`: Full name string ("First Last")
- `contact`: Combined contact info ("email|phone")
- `position`: Job title/position
- `hire_date`: ISO date string
- `salary`: Numeric value
- `status`: Can be either a standard status or contain department information:
  - Standard: 'active', 'inactive', 'on_leave'
  - With department: 'dept:department_name'
- `created_at`: Timestamp

### Domain Model Structure
The domain model provides a more usable structure:
- Separates name into `first_name` and `last_name`
- Separates contact info into `email` and `phone`
- Extracts department info from status field into dedicated `department` property
- Normalizes status to valid values
- Adds placeholders for empty values

## Migration Checklist
- [x] Update service imports to prevent circular dependencies
- [x] Create mapper utilities with comprehensive tests
- [x] Ensure type safety throughout the feature
- [ ] Update UI components to use the new service
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Conduct integration testing

## Improvements Made

### Enhanced Form Experience
- Migrated to use the Form component from Shadcn UI
- Added proper validation with Zod schema
- Improved error messaging with form field validation
- Added department dropdown with predefined options

### Performance Improvements
- Added caching with React Query
- Implemented optimistic updates for mutations
- Added stale time settings for queries
- Improved error handling with retry capabilities

### Type Safety
- Ensured consistent types throughout the feature
- Used Zod to enforce schema validation
- Implemented proper TypeScript typing for all components

### Added Comprehensive Documentation
- Added comprehensive documentation for the feature
- Updated existing documentation to reflect the new architecture
- Conducted integration testing to ensure compatibility with the new feature-based architecture
