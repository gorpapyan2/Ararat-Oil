## Verdict

**âœ… MIGRATION COMPLETE: It is safe to remove the components directory**

## Recommendation

1. Make a backup of the components directory (already done to `backups/components-backup`)
2. Run TypeScript type checking once more (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
3. Remove the components directory (`rm -rf src/components`)
4. Verify the application builds and runs correctly
