# Storybook Migration Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of migrating Storybook stories from the centralized `src/stories` directory to our feature-based architecture, ensuring all UI components have proper documentation and showcase capabilities.

## Migration Status

| Card | `src/stories/Card.stories.tsx` | `src/core/components/ui/__stories__/card.stories.tsx` | ✅ Completed |
| DatePicker | `src/stories/DatePicker.stories.tsx` | `src/core/components/ui/__stories__/datepicker.stories.tsx` | ✅ Completed |
| DateRangePicker | `src/stories/DateRangePicker.stories.tsx` | `src/core/components/ui/__stories__/daterangepicker.stories.tsx` | ✅ Completed |
| Header | `src/stories/Header.stories.ts` | `src/features/layout/components/__stories__/Header.stories.tsx` | ✅ Completed |
| Page | `src/stories/Page.stories.ts` | `src/features/layout/components/__stories__/Page.stories.tsx` | ✅ Completed |

## Improvements Made

1. **Updated Component Organization**
   - Moved stories to be co-located with their component implementations
   - Organized story hierarchy to reflect feature-based architecture
   - Improved title structure in Storybook sidebar

2. **Documentation Enhancements**
   - Added references to the Ararat OIL design system color palette (#000000, #3E432E, #616F39, #A7D129)
   - Improved component descriptions
   - Enhanced story organization with better categorization

3. **UI Updates**
   - Ensured all components follow the olive-lime color palette
   - Maintained consistent styling across components
   - Improved visual representation in Storybook

## Next Steps

1. **Update Storybook Configuration**
   - ✅ All core component stories have been migrated
   - Ensure proper organization in Storybook sidebar
   - Add theme customization to match Ararat OIL branding
   - Configure viewports for responsive testing

2. **Update Storybook Configuration**
   - Ensure proper organization in Storybook sidebar
   - Add theme customization to match Ararat OIL branding
   - Configure viewports for responsive testing

3. **Create Feature Component Stories**
   - Identify feature-specific components that need stories
   - Create stories for these components in their feature directories
   - Ensure consistent documentation patterns

4. **Documentation**
   - Update main README with information about Storybook usage
   - Create component showcase documentation
   - Document patterns for creating new component stories

## Integration with Feature Architecture

This migration aligns with the broader feature-based architecture refactoring by:

1. Co-locating story files with their component implementations
2. Organizing stories by feature/domain
3. Following consistent naming and location patterns
4. Supporting the established separation of concerns

## Timeline

- Current Phase: Core UI Component Migration
- Next Phase: Feature-specific Component Migration
- Final Phase: Documentation and Showcase Implementation

## Conclusion

The Storybook migration supports the broader refactoring goals by providing better component documentation, visual testing capabilities, and alignment with the feature-based architecture. This work contributes to the project's overall maintainability, testability, and scalability while preserving the established design system.
