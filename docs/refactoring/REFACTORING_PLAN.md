# Feature-Based Architecture Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to refactor the application into a feature-based architecture. The goal is to improve maintainability, scalability, and code organization by organizing code around business features rather than technical concerns.

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Features (Completed)
- âœ… Auth Feature Migration
- âœ… Finance Feature Migration
- âœ… Petrol Providers Feature Migration

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (In Progress)
- [ ] User Management
- [ ] Role-based Access Control
- [ ] System Settings
- [ ] Audit Logging

### Phase 3: UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Component Standardization
- [ ] Design System Implementation
- [ ] Documentation Updates
- [ ] Performance Optimization

## Security Considerations

- All edge functions require authentication
- Data access is restricted to authorized users
- Input validation is performed on the edge
- Sensitive data is properly handled

## Performance Goals

- Reduce client-side code
- Improve error handling
- Enhance data validation
- Optimize database queries

## Documentation

- Feature migration guides
- API documentation
- Component documentation
- Testing guidelines

## Rollback Plan

Each feature has its own rollback plan in its migration guide. If issues arise:

1. Restore original service files
2. Remove edge functions
3. Update components to use direct Supabase calls
4. Revert to previous implementation

## Success Metrics

- Reduced client-side code
- Improved error handling
- Enhanced security
- Better maintainability
- Comprehensive documentation
- Complete test coverage
