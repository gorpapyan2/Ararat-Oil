# Feature-Based Architecture Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to refactor the application into a feature-based architecture. The goal is to improve maintainability, scalability, and code organization by organizing code around business features rather than technical concerns.

## Completed Core Functionality

### API Standardization âœ…
- Moved API modules from scattered services to centralized `src/core/api/endpoints`
- Standardized method naming (e.g., `getSales` instead of `getAll`)
- Implemented consistent response typing with `ApiResponse<T>`
- Added proper error handling and type transformations
- Implemented type adapters for data transformation
- Updated all components to use the new API structure

### i18n Migration âœ…
- Created standardized API translation helpers in `src/i18n/api-translations.ts`
- Updated `i18n.ts` to export these helpers
- Added unit tests for translation helpers
- Updated all components to use these helpers
- Implemented consistent error and success messages

## Testing Progress
- API Client Tests: âœ…
- Adapter Tests: âœ…
- Translation Helper Tests: âœ…
- API Method Tests: ðŸ”„
- Integration Tests: ðŸ”„
- Component Tests: ðŸ”„

## Lessons Learned
- The API namespace must match the endpoint precisely (e.g., use `apiNamespaces.finances` not `apiNamespaces.finance`)
- Type adapters proved valuable for maintaining consistency between API and UI models
- The standardized translation approach significantly improved user experience with consistent messaging
- Component updates should be done systematically to ensure consistent import patterns

## Timeline for Remaining Work

| Task | Priority | Estimated Time |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Complete API Method Tests | High | 1 week |
| Finish Documentation | Medium | 1 week |
| Perform Integration Testing | High | 2 weeks |
| Refine Error Handling | Medium | 1 week |
| Implement Performance Monitoring | Low | 1 week |

## Success Metrics
- Reduced client-side code
- Improved error handling
- Enhanced security
- Better maintainability
- Comprehensive documentation
- Complete test coverage
