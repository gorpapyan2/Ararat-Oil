# Card Components Standardization Plan

## Current State Analysis

After analyzing the codebase, we've identified the following issues with the current card component implementation:

1. **Multiple Component Hierarchies**: 
   - `src/core/components/ui/primitives/card.tsx` - Contains base primitives and styled components
   - `src/core/components/ui/primitives/cards.tsx` - Contains specialized cards (StatsCard, MetricCard, etc.)
   - `src/core/components/ui/composed/cards.tsx` - Contains another set of specialized cards with overlapping functionality

2. **Inconsistency Issues**:
   - Different naming conventions (`card.tsx` vs `cards.tsx`)
   - Duplicated components with similar functionality but different APIs
   - Inconsistent prop interfaces between similar components
   - Varying styles and visual treatments

3. **Usage Patterns**:
   - Many components import cards from different sources
   - Inconsistent usage of card sub-components (CardHeader, CardTitle, etc.)
   - Different approaches to styling (direct className vs. variants)

## Standardization Goals

1. **Unified Component System**:
   - Create a single, cohesive card system with clear hierarchy
   - Eliminate redundant implementations
   - Standardize the API across all card variants

2. **Improved Developer Experience**:
   - Provide a consistent interface for all card components
   - Clear documentation and usage examples
   - Type-safe props with sensible defaults

3. **Enhanced Accessibility**:
   - Ensure all cards have proper ARIA attributes
   - Keyboard navigation support where applicable
   - Support for high contrast mode and other accessibility features

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Consistent behavior across different screen sizes
   - Mobile-first approach with appropriate breakpoint handling

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Base Component Refactoring

1. **Create Core Card Primitives**:
   - `Card` - The base container
   - `CardHeader` - Container for title and description
   - `CardTitle` - Card heading with proper semantics
   - `CardDescription` - Secondary text description
   - `CardContent` - Main content area
   - `CardFooter` - Footer area for actions
   - `CardMedia` - For images and media content
   - `CardActions` - Container for action buttons

2. **Define Shared Props and Types**:
   - Common props interface for all card components
   - Standardized size, variant, and color options
   - Shared accessibility props

### Phase 2: Specialized Card Components

1. **Create Standardized Variant Cards**:
   - `MetricCard` - For displaying numerical metrics with optional trends
   - `ActionCard` - Cards with prominent call-to-action buttons
   - `StatsCard` - Simple statistics display
   - `SummaryCard` - For summarizing multiple metrics
   - `InfoCard` - For displaying informational content

2. **Layout Components**:
   - `CardGrid` - Responsive grid layout for cards
   - `CardGroup` - Grouped cards with shared styling

### Phase 3: Migration and Documentation

1. **Migration Strategy**:
   - Create an export compatibility layer for seamless transition
   - Update existing components to use new standardized cards
   - Deprecate old implementations

2. **Documentation**:
   - Create comprehensive usage guide
   - Add examples for common use cases
   - Document accessibility features

3. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for all card components
   - Visual regression tests
   - Accessibility tests

## Proposed Component Structure

```
src/
  core/
    components/
      ui/
        cards/
          card.tsx            - Base card components
          metric-card.tsx     - Metric display card
          action-card.tsx     - Card with prominent actions
          stats-card.tsx      - Statistics card
          summary-card.tsx    - Summary information card
          info-card.tsx       - Information display card
          card-grid.tsx       - Layout components for cards
          index.ts            - Public exports
```

## Timeline and Milestones

1. **Week 1**: Base component refactoring
2. **Week 2**: Specialized card components implementation
3. **Week 3**: Migration of existing components
4. **Week 4**: Documentation and testing

## Success Metrics

- **Duplication Reduction**: Remove 100% of duplicated card component code
- **Consistency**: Achieve consistent prop interfaces across all card variants
- **Adoption**: Migrate 100% of existing card usage to standardized components
- **Accessibility**: Pass all WCAG AA criteria for card components
