# TODO: Internationalization (i18n)

## Goals

- Improve language support and translation management.
- Make translations scalable and user-friendly.

## Steps

1. Add support for async loading of translations (code splitting, dynamic imports).
2. Provide a UI for language switching in the app header or settings.
3. Add missing translation keys and ensure fallback handling for missing translations.
4. Test the app in all supported languages for completeness and layout issues.
5. Document the process for adding new languages and updating translations.
