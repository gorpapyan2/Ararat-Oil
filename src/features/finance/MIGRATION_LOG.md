# Finance Feature Migration Log

## Migration Date: 2025-01-28

### What Was Done
1. ✅ Created `pages` directory within the finance feature
2. ✅ Moved all page components from `src/pages/finance/`:
   - `ExpenseCreate.tsx`
   - `ExpenseForm.tsx`
   - `ExpensesPage.tsx`
   - `FinanceDashboard.tsx`
   - `FinancePage.tsx`
3. ✅ Created index file for pages directory with proper exports
4. ✅ Updated feature index to export page components and types
5. ✅ Verified old directory is now empty

### Key Observations
- All page components were already using feature-based imports
- ExpenseForm exports both component and types
- Finance feature has good component organization
- No import changes needed within the migrated files

### Structure Achieved
```
src/features/finance/
├── components/       # UI components
├── hooks/           # Custom hooks
├── pages/           # Page components (newly added)
├── services/        # API services
├── types/           # TypeScript types
└── index.ts         # Public API
```

### Next Steps
- Test all finance routes and functionality
- Remove empty `src/pages/finance` directory
- Verify expense creation flow works
- Test profit/loss calculations

### Benefits Achieved
- ✅ Complete feature encapsulation
- ✅ All finance code in one location
- ✅ Better code organization
- ✅ Easier testing and maintenance
- ✅ Clear separation between pages and components
