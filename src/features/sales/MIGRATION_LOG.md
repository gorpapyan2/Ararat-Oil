# Sales Feature Migration Log

## Migration Date: 2025-01-28

### What Was Done
1. ✅ Created `pages` directory within the sales feature
2. ✅ Moved all page components from `src/pages/sales/` to `src/features/sales/pages/`
   - `SalesPage.tsx`
   - `SalesNew.tsx`
   - `SalesCreate.tsx`
3. ✅ Created index file for pages directory
4. ✅ Updated feature index to export page components
5. ✅ Verified no remaining references to old location
6. ✅ Old pages directory is now empty

### Key Observations
- All page components were already using feature-based imports
- No changes to imports were needed within the page files
- The migration was smooth due to good preparation

### Routing Update Status
- ⚠️ Could not locate the main routing configuration
- The application may be using dynamic imports or a custom routing solution
- No broken imports were found after migration

### Next Steps
- Test the application to ensure all sales routes work correctly
- Update any routing configuration if issues are found
- Remove the empty `src/pages/sales` directory

### Benefits Achieved
- ✅ Complete feature encapsulation
- ✅ All sales-related code now in one location
- ✅ Easier to maintain and test
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
