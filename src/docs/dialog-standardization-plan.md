# Dialog Standardization Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation progress for standardizing dialog components across the application.

## Current Status

- [x] Created dialog primitives with focus management and accessibility features
- [x] Created styled dialog components
- [x] Created composed dialog components (StandardDialog, ConfirmDialog, AlertDialog, DeleteConfirmDialog)
- [x] Implemented dialog hooks for state management
- [x] Created usage examples for documentation
- [ ] Migrate existing dialogs to use new components
- [ ] Create documentation for usage guidelines

## Architecture

We've implemented a 3-layer architecture approach for dialog components:

1. **Primitives Layer**: Basic accessible dialog components with focus management

   - Located in `src/components/ui/primitives/dialog.tsx`
   - Provides core functionality: focus trapping, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes

2. **Styled Layer**: Components with styling applied

   - Located in `src/components/ui/styled/dialog.tsx`
   - Applies consistent styling to primitives

3. **Composed Layer**: Ready-to-use dialog patterns

   - Located in `src/components/ui/composed/dialog.tsx`
   - Provides common dialog patterns: standard dialogs, confirmation dialogs, alert dialogs

4. **Hooks**: For managing dialog state
   - Located in `src/hooks/useDialog.ts`
   - Provides hooks for standard, confirmation, and alert dialogs

## Components Implemented

### Primitives:

- [x] `DialogPrimitive` - Base dialog with accessibility features
- [x] `AlertDialogPrimitive` - Base alert dialog
- [x] `DialogTitlePrimitive` - Dialog title
- [x] `DialogDescriptionPrimitive` - Dialog description
- [x] `DialogContentPrimitive` - Dialog content
- [x] `DialogFooterPrimitive` - Dialog footer
- [x] `DialogClosePrimitive` - Dialog close button

### Styled Components:

- [x] `Dialog` - Styled dialog
- [x] `DialogTitle` - Styled dialog title
- [x] `DialogDescription` - Styled dialog description
- [x] `DialogContent` - Styled dialog content
- [x] `DialogFooter` - Styled dialog footer
- [x] `DialogClose` - Styled dialog close button
- [x] `AlertDialog` - Styled alert dialog
- [x] `AlertDialogTitle` - Styled alert dialog title
- [x] `AlertDialogDescription` - Styled alert dialog description

### Composed Components:

- [x] `StandardDialog` - General-purpose dialog
- [x] `ConfirmDialog` - Dialog for confirming actions
- [x] `AlertMessageDialog` - Dialog for alerts and messages
- [x] `DeleteConfirmDialog` - Dialog for confirming deletions

### Hooks:

- [x] `useDialog` - General dialog state management
- [x] `useConfirmDialog` - Confirmation dialog state management
- [x] `useAlertDialog` - Alert dialog state management with dynamic content

## Features Implemented

- [x] **Accessibility**

  - Focus management (trap focus, return focus)
  - ARIA attributes
  - Keyboard navigation (Escape to close, Tab trapping)
  - Screen reader support

- [x] **Responsive Design**

  - Mobile-friendly layouts
  - Responsive actions footer

- [x] **Developer Experience**
  - Consistent API
  - Comprehensive hooks for state management
  - Type safety

## Migration Plan

Phase 1: Critical Components (Next 2 weeks)

- [ ] Migrate `SalesDialogs` to use standardized dialogs
- [ ] Migrate `ExpensesDialogs` to use standardized dialogs
- [ ] Migrate `DeleteConfirmation` components to use standardized `DeleteConfirmDialog`

Phase 2: Secondary Components (Following 2 weeks)

- [ ] Migrate remaining form-related dialogs
- [ ] Migrate confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Migrate alert dialogs

Phase 3: Final Components (Final 2 weeks)

- [ ] Migrate any custom dialogs
- [ ] Deprecate old dialog components
- [ ] Update tests and documentation

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Standardized dialogs provide a consistent experience across the application
2. **Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility features
3. **Developer Experience**: Simplified API for creating and managing dialogs
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized dialog logic makes updates easier
5. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Shared components reduce duplication

## Next Steps

1. Begin migrating existing dialogs to use the new components
2. Create comprehensive documentation for the dialog components
3. Add automated tests for dialog components
4. Update design guidelines with new dialog patterns

## Examples

See `src/examples/DialogExamples.tsx` for usage examples of all dialog components.
