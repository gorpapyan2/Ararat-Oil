# Sales Component Standardization Status

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of standardizing the sales components across the application to align with our UI component standardization efforts.

## Completed Refactorings

- ✅ Removed `SalesDialogs.tsx` - Replaced with `SalesDialogsStandardized.tsx` and `SalesDialogsHooked.tsx`
- ✅ Removed `SalesForm.tsx` - Replaced with `SalesFormStandardized.tsx`
- ✅ Updated `NewSaleButton.tsx` - Now uses `SalesFormStandardized` instead of `SalesForm`
- ✅ Updated `SalesNew.tsx` - Now uses `SalesDialogsStandardized` instead of `SalesDialogs`
- ✅ Updated `form/PriceAndEmployeeInputs.tsx` - Refactored to use standardized form components
- ✅ Updated `form/FillingSystemSelect.tsx` - Refactored to use standardized form components
- ✅ Updated imports throughout the application to use the standardized components

## Standardized Components

### Form Components

- `SalesFormStandardized.tsx` - Uses zod validation and standardized form field components
- `PriceAndEmployeeInputs.tsx` - Updated to use `FormCurrencyInput` and `FormSelect`
- `FillingSystemSelect.tsx` - Updated to use `FormSelect`

### Dialog Components

- `SalesDialogsStandardized.tsx` - Uses the standardized dialog components
- `SalesDialogsHooked.tsx` - Uses dialog hooks for better state management and separation of concerns

### Controller Pattern

- `SalesController.tsx` - Provides a complete UI for creating, editing, and managing sales with standardized components

## Benefits

- **Consistent API**: All sales components now follow a consistent API pattern
- **Improved Type Safety**: Added zod validation and improved TypeScript support
- **Better State Management**: Implemented hook-based state management for dialogs
- **Simplified Forms**: Using standardized form components reduces code duplication
- **Enhanced UX**: Standardized components provide a consistent user experience

## Next Steps

1. Update remaining filter components in `sales/filters/` to use standardized patterns
2. Add comprehensive tests for sales components
3. Create examples demonstrating the standardized sales components
4. Update the documentation with more detailed usage examples

## Migration Guide

### Migrating from `SalesDialogs` to `SalesDialogsStandardized`

```tsx
// Before
import { SalesDialogs } from "@/components/sales/SalesDialogs";

// After
import { SalesDialogsStandardized } from "@/components/sales/SalesDialogsStandardized";
```

### Migrating to Hook-based Dialog Management

For components that need access to sales dialog functionality, consider using the hook-based approach:

```tsx
// Before
const [isEditDialogOpen, setIsEditDialogOpen] = useState(false);
const [selectedSale, setSelectedSale] = useState<Sale | null>(null);

// After
import { useSalesDialog } from "@/hooks/useSalesDialog";

const {
  isEditDialogOpen,
  selectedSale,
  handleEditDialogOpenChange,
  // ...other state and handlers
} = useSalesDialog({
  onCreateSuccess: (sale) => {/* handle success */},
  onUpdateSuccess: (sale) => {/* handle success */},
  onDeleteSuccess: (id) => {/* handle success */},
});
```

### Using the Controller Pattern

For components that need to embed sales management functionality:

```tsx
import { SalesController } from "@/components/sales/SalesController";

<SalesController 
  onCreateSuccess={(sale) => {/* handle success */}}
  onUpdateSuccess={(sale) => {/* handle success */}}
  onDeleteSuccess={(id) => {/* handle success */}}
  triggerButton={<CustomButton>Manage Sales</CustomButton>}
/>
```
