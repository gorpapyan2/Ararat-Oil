# Component Removal Report

## Overview

This document outlines the components that have been removed as part of our standardization efforts. All functionality provided by these components has been replaced with standardized components that offer improved API design, accessibility, and consistency across the application.

## Removed Components

### Table Components

| Removed Component | Replacement |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `UnifiedDataTable` | `StandardizedDataTable` |
| `mobile-aware-data-table.tsx` | `StandardizedDataTable` with responsive props |
| `enhanced-table.tsx` | `StandardizedDataTable` |
| `ui-custom/table.tsx` | `@/components/ui/table` |

### UI-Custom Components

| Removed Component | Replacement |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `ui-custom/page-header.tsx` | `@/components/ui/page-header` |
| `ui-custom/data-card.tsx` | `@/components/ui/composed/cards` |
| `ui-custom/card.tsx` | `@/components/ui/card` |
| `ui-custom/index.ts` | Direct imports from standardized components |
| `ui/card-grid.tsx` | `@/components/ui/composed/cards` |
| `ThemeToggle.tsx` | `@/components/ui/ThemeSwitcher` |

### Tests

| Removed Test | Notes |
|--------------|-------|
| `ui-custom/__tests__` | All tests for the removed components have been replaced with tests for the standardized components |

## Benefits

1. **Reduced code duplication**: Eliminated multiple implementations of similar components
2. **Simplified architecture**: Clearer import paths and component organization
3. **Improved developer experience**: Consistent component APIs and better documentation
4. **Reduced bundle size**: Fewer redundant components
5. **Better documentation**: Centralized documentation for standardized components
6. **Enhanced testing**: More comprehensive test coverage for standardized components

## Next Steps

1. Identify any remaining deprecated components
2. Monitor application for any errors related to the removed components
3. Plan for form component standardization
4. Continue to identify opportunities for component cleanup and standardization
5. Update imports in any files that might still reference the removed components

## Usage Guide

Update imports in your files:

**Old imports:**
```tsx
import { CardGrid, MetricCard } from "@/components/ui/card-grid";
import { ThemeToggle } from "@/components/ThemeToggle";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui-custom/card";
```

**New imports:**
```tsx
import { CardGrid, MetricCard } from "@/components/ui/composed/cards";
import { ThemeSwitcher } from "@/components/ui/ThemeSwitcher";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
```
