## Recent Updates

### Component Import Refactoring (Complete)

The following components have been updated to use their standardized versions:

1. **ExpensesManager.tsx**: Now using `ExpensesFormStandardized`
2. **TankManager.tsx**: Now using `TankFormStandardized`
3. **EmployeesNew.tsx**: Now using `EmployeeDialogStandardized`
4. **TodoList.tsx**: Now using `TodoFormStandardized`
5. **PetrolProviders.tsx**: Now using `ProviderDialogStandardized`

New standardized components created:

1. **ProviderDialogStandardized.tsx**: Created standardized version with Zod validation
2. **TodoFormStandardized.tsx**: Created standardized version with Zod validation

### Dialog Component Improvements

- Updated `ProviderDialogStandardized` to use the `StandardDialog` component for improved consistency and accessibility
- Fixed interface issues to match the standardized component patterns

This direct refactoring approach was preferred over bridge files for these components as they are less widely used throughout the application. Direct refactoring provides immediate benefits:

- Improved code quality and consistency
- Reduced maintenance burden
- Better validation and user experience
- Enhanced developer experience with standardized components

### Interface Fixes

Fixed interface issues in the following components:

1. **EmployeesNew.tsx**: Updated component props to match standardized interfaces
2. **FuelSuppliesManager.tsx**: Fixed handler functions and prop names to match component requirements
3. **PetrolProviders.tsx**: Updated props to match the `ProviderDialogStandardized` interface

### Next Steps

Continue the refactoring process for any remaining components, focusing on:

1. Check for any other instances of non-standardized components in use

## Next Steps

1. Create unit tests for all form components
2. Perform accessibility testing on form components
3. Add the form showcase page to the development tools menu
4. Add documentation for the migration process and best practices
5. Consider deprecating old form components

## Timeline

- **Q2 2025**: Core implementation and documentation ✅
