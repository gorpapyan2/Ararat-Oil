## Implementation Highlights

### 3-Layer Architecture
We've successfully implemented a 3-layer architecture for our dialog components:

1. **Core Dialog Components** (100% Complete)
   - `StandardDialog` - Base component for all dialogs
   - `ConfirmDialog` - For simple confirmation dialogs
   - `AlertDialog` - For notifications and alerts

2. **State Management Hooks** (100% Complete)
   - `useDialog` - Base hook for dialog state
   - `useConfirmDialog` - For confirmation dialogs
   - `useConfirmationDialog` - For flexible confirmation patterns
   - `useEmployeeDialog` - For employee management
   - `useSalesDialog` - For sales management
   - `useTankDialog` - For fuel tank management
   - `useProfileDialog` - For user profile management
   - `useLoginDialog` - For authentication
   - `useMultiStepDialog` - For multi-step dialog workflows

3. **Standardized Dialog Components** (100% Complete)
   - Components that utilize the core components and hooks
   - Consistent API and behavior across all dialogs

### Component Controllers
We've introduced a new pattern for dialog management:

- `SalesController` - Provides a complete UI for creating, editing, and managing sales
  - Integrates with `useSalesDialog` hook
  - Provides both dialog state management and UI controls
  - Can be embedded in tables or standalone UI

- `TankController` - Provides an interface for creating and managing fuel tanks
  - Integrates with `useTankDialog` hook
  - Simplifies tank creation with standardized validation
  - Consistent confirmation flow

- `ProfileController` - Provides an interface for editing user profiles
  - Integrates with `useProfileDialog` hook
  - Manages profile data and avatar updates
  - Centralized control for profile editing

- `ConfirmationController` - Provides a flexible interface for confirmation dialogs
  - Uses a render props pattern for maximum flexibility
  - Supports multiple confirmation types (default, destructive, warning, info)
  - Simplifies confirmation flows across the application

- `LoginController` - Provides an interface for authentication
  - Integrates with `useLoginDialog` hook
  - Supports both email/password and social login
  - Handles authentication state and errors

This controller pattern helps standardize dialog integration in parent components and reduces boilerplate code.

### Import Standardization
We've standardized imports across the application:

1. **Centralized Export Files**
   - Created `src/hooks/index.ts` exporting all dialog hooks
   - Created `src/components/ui/index.ts` exporting all UI components
   - Created `src/components/dialogs/index.ts` exporting all dialog components
   - Created `src/components/auth/index.ts` exporting all auth components
   - Created `src/examples/index.ts` exporting all example components

2. **Import Path Simplification**
   - Updated components to use centralized imports
   - Reduced duplication and improved maintainability
   - Simplified refactoring by centralizing component exports

3. **Benefits**
   - Easier maintenance when component locations change
   - Reduced import statements in each file
   - Cleaner code with standardized import patterns
   - Simpler component discovery through centralized exports

## Advanced Patterns Demonstrated
- **Multi-step forms** with state preservation between steps
- **Progress indicators** for multi-step workflows
- **Form validation** at each step with clear error handling
- **Back/next navigation** with state persistence
- **Conditional rendering** based on current step
- **Loading states** during form submission
- **Table integration** with row actions and dialog controllers
- **Confirmation flows** with consistent UX for critical actions
- **Media handling** with avatar upload/removal in profile dialogs
- **Authentication flows** with social login support
- **Flexible confirmation patterns** with render props

## Benefits Achieved
- **Consistency**: Standardized appearance and behavior across all dialogs
- **Accessibility**: Improved keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Code Reuse**: Reduced duplication through shared components and hooks
- **Developer Experience**: Simplified API for creating and managing dialogs
- **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain with centralized components

## Next Steps
1. Complete documentation for all standardized dialogs
2. Add unit tests for core components and hooks
3. Implement more specialized dialog patterns:
   - ⬜ Nested dialogs example
   - ⬜ Dynamic content dialogs
   - ✅ Multi-step workflows
   - ✅ Confirmation flows
   - ✅ Media upload dialogs
   - ✅ Authentication flows

## Success Stories
- **Employee Dialog**: Successfully migrated to use StandardDialog and created a custom hook for state management, reducing complexity and improving reusability
- **Sales Dialog**: Created a comprehensive controller pattern that integrates with tables and simplifies dialog state management
- **Expenses Dialog**: Simplified from 250+ lines to approximately 180 lines while adding better validation
- **Category Manager**: Improved accessibility and user experience through standardized patterns
- **Tank Dialog**: Migrated from two separate components to an integrated system with a custom hook, standardizing the creation flow
- **Profile Dialog**: Transformed a form component into a dialog system with avatar management capabilities
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Created a flexible system for confirmations using render props pattern, supporting multiple confirmation types
- **Login Dialog**: Standardized authentication with support for multiple providers, error handling, and redirect flows
- **Multi-Step Dialog Example**: Demonstrates how our standardized components can handle complex workflows

## Timeline
